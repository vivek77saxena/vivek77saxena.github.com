I currently live and work in New Jersey. I work on front-end for most and love building
web applications with responsive design and an appealing UI using JavaScript, AngularJS, NodeJS, and lot other front-end libraries and frameworks. I also enjoy working on applications with Java, J2EE backend but these days more like the flexibility of working in the front end. Besides that I am all for learning something new every day. Or to say in other way I see the below expressions to to be somewhat true.

    1.01 :  1.01365 =  37.8 //pushing everyday in bits you gain a lot
    0.99 : 0.99365  =  0.03 //rather than slacking every day 
                                                          [Read more](http://taiwanrocks.net/training-principle-the-1-01-law/)          
I like challenges and problem solving in a more thoughtful way combining creativity and logic. During development I like the iterative approach but my professional experience taught me to be flexible depending on different scenarios.
