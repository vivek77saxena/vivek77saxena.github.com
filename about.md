I currently live and work in New Jersey. I work on front-end for most and love building
web applications with responsive design and an appealing UI using JavaScript, AngularJS, NodeJS, and lot other front-end libraries and frameworks. I also enjoy working on applications with Java, J2EE backend but these days more like the flexibility of working in the front end. Besides that I am all for learning something new every day. Or to say in other way I see the below expressions to to be somewhat true.

    1.01 :  1.01365 =  37.8 //pushing everyday in bits you gain a lot
    0.99 : 0.99365  =  0.03 //rather than slacking every day

I like challenges and problem solving in a more thoughtful way combining creativity and logic. During development I like the iterative approach but my professional experience taught me to be flexible depending on different scenarios.

I am a [MD-PhD student](http://www.md.utoronto.ca/current-student-biographies) at [The University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/). I started the program in 2013 and after 1 year of the MD program, in 2014, began my PhD with [Dr. Paul Frankland](http://www.franklandlab.com/) at [The Hospital for Sick Children](http://www.sickkids.ca/). 

Before starting on the 8 year journey to become a clinician scientist I was a masters student under [Dr. Jason Lerch](http://medbio.utoronto.ca/faculty/lerch.html) at the Mouse Imaging Centre - elaborated on [here]({% post_url 2014-07-29-msc %}). Before that I was an undergraduate student at [McMaster University](http://www.mcmaster.ca/) - I outlined the program [here]({% post_url 2014-07-28-bsc %}).

I am interested in many aspects of medicine, neuroscience, computer science, open science (and open government) and writing. I will use this website to write about these and share what I learn throughout my studies.
