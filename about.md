In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

I currently live and work in New Jersey. I work on front-end for most and love building
web applications with responsive design and an appealing UI using JavaScript, AngularJS, NodeJS, and lot other front-end libraries and frameworks. I also enjoy working on applications with Java, J2EE backend but these days more like the flexibility of working in the front end. Besides that I am all for learning something new every day. Or to say in other way I see the below expressions to to be somewhat true.

    1.01 :  1.01365 =  37.8 //pushing everyday in bits you again
    0.99 : 0.99365  =  0.03 //rather than slacking every day

I like challenges and problem solving in a more thoughtful way combining creativity and logic. During development I like the iterative approach but my professional experience taught me to be flexible depending on different scenarios.
