"Optimism? Pessimism? F*** that. We're going to make it happen. As God as my bloody witness, I'm hell-bent on making it work." - Elon Musk

-------------------------------------------------------
There was time when time felt wrong, Then there was you.
There was time when nothing helped, Then there was you.

I wrote and I paddled my gloomy boat, I sang, I ran, I shook my 'I can'

Inner beauty, lively darling, you are everywhere
I was so empty.

Then there was you.
